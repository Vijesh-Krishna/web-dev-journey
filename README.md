## 🧭 What to Expect

The website will walk visitors through **three major phases of my web development journey**:

   - Focused on structure, content, and design basics.

2. **📱 Responsive Websites (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)**  
   - Intermediate projects where I learned to make pages **look great on all screen sizes**.

3. **⚡ Dynamic Websites (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)**  
   - Projects that include **interactive elements** and basic functionality to bring websites to life.
